## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README

Update this file as you go along to record your progress.

I really didn't know what to do for this, I had lots of ideas but not really something that would work. I like the idea of incorporating a car and a road somehow, I thought other options could be one from a drivers perspective and use maybe the speedo and road signs instead - or have a top down view of some car lanes - the cars would have numebers on their roofs - the fast lane being the seconds of course. In the below example the mile signs would show seconds, the minutes in the midground and the hours on the sun - sort of based off the parallax concept.

Working on changing the colour modes so that they work more cohesively in the landscapes and make sense changing colours in the daytime vs. at night.
I also found a way to use the modulo % to keep the 'hour' numeral a different colour from the rest of the others. This mostly works except at night the background colours are a bit similar, but I think I've found a way around that.
I have begun adding elements to create the alarm - my idea is that the car will start speeding - maybe with a siren and the landscape will start to blur past while the hour flahses. Getting a seamless transition between the alarm going and not may be difficult though.
